# Titanic Dataset Analysis using Streamlit

This project provides an interactive analysis of the Titanic dataset using Streamlit. It allows users to explore the dataset, visualize survival rates, handle missing values, and save a cleaned version of the dataset.

## Features
- Display raw Titanic dataset
- Check missing values and data statistics
- Visualize survival rates by gender, age group, and passenger class
- Handle missing values by imputing or removing columns
- Encode categorical variables and engineer new features
- Save and read the cleaned dataset
